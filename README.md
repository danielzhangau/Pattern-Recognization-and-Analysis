# Pattern Recognization
Understanding patterns in our environment and in data is an important cognitive ability. The development of recognition and automated algorithms that are able to process copious amounts data without (or with limited) human intervention is critical in human intervention is critical in replicating this ability in machines. \
This course will cover the fundamentals of creating computational algorithms that are able to recognise and/or analyse patterns within data of various forms. Topics and algorithms will include fractal geometry, classification methods such as random forests, recognition problems using deep learning and models of the human vision system. Python and stat-of-the-art packages like Tensorflow will be used as a mechanism for students to study patterns in nature, noise and data from various real-worlds sources, such images, social media and biomedical signals.

## Three Main parts in this course:
1. Patterns in nature – how symmetry and self-similarity leads to the patterns we observe in nature, such as fractals and the known particles of the universe.
2. Traditional pattern recognition – how patterns are quantified, measured and identified using features, similarity, information theory, principles of transform domains and decision trees.
3. Convolutional neural networks – how the idea of receptive fields and convolutions are used to learn appropriate multi-scale, self-adaptive features via neural networks.

## What I have learned:
1. solving pattern recognition problems, especially via deep convolutional neural networks
2. a deep learning framework, such as Tensorflow or PyTorch
3. algorithmic design incorporating software engineering principles, while contributing to a course run open source project, PatternFlow – a pattern recognition and image processing library for Tensorflow
4. mathematical frameworks involved in understanding patterns and principles required for all of the above, such as group theory and tensor calculus

## Skills developed:
1.	Demonstrate their mathematical theory of patterns such as symmetry groups and fractal geometry
2.	Extract and interpret patterns that exist in data and for solving recognition problems
3.	Make use of different transform domains and dimensionality reduction in identifying patterns
4.	Distinguishing when to apply and make use of decision trees to various large datasets
5.	Distinguishing when to apply and make use of convolutional neural networks
6.	Demonstrate the ability to develop algorithms, while applying appropriate software engineering principles
7.	Develop heterogeneous computing solutions using industry grade software packages such as Tensorflow and PyTorch
8.	Effectively communicate (using oral and written communication and appropriate figures and visualisations) the purpose, operation, technical functionality and research directions related to a pattern recognition algorithm
